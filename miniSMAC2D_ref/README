c main program file: smac2d.f

c Required input files:
c   1. xy.dat_original          original grid file, 1 block only;
c                               formatted, plot3d format
c   2. bcmain.dat_original      main boundary condition file for 
c                               original grid; formatted
C
c   All other necessary files are internally generated:
c   1. GRIDS2D
c   2. bcpzn.dat
c   3. GRID_DIVIDED_3D.G
c   4. bcmain.dat
c   5. bcwake.dat
c
c To run 32-node case on Sandia's redsky:
c   1. allocate 4 nodes, where FYxxxxxxx comes from Sandia's Workload
c      Characterization Tool, or WC Tool:
c       salloc -N4 --time=4:00:00 --account=FYxxxxxxx bash
c   2. compile code:
c       cd <code_directory>
c       make mpi  ! creates mpi executable smac2d
c    or
c       make mpiandthreads ! creates mpi+threads executable smac2d
c   3. to run 8 cores per node (for 32 cores total) using MPI only:
c       mpirun -npernode 8 smac2d > smac2d.out
       to run 8 cores per node with 4 threads per socket of each node:
        mpirun -npernode 8 env OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./smac2d > smac2d.out

c   Description: 
c    1. This code solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes
c       equations in two-dimensional generalized coordinates for 
c       steady-state flow.  
c    2. The equations are formulated into a hyperbolic set of PDEs using 
c       the method of artificial compressibility.  
c    3. Convective terms are differenced using an upwind biased 
c       flux-difference splitting.  
c    4. The equations are solved using a line relaxation or symmetric
c       Gauss-Seidel solver.
c    5. For parallel processing, a one-block grid is partitioned into
c       a user-specified number of subgrids. The code takes care of 
c       generating one grid cell overlap with point-to-point matching,
c       as well as ensuring the partitioning process minimizes the
c       surface-area-to-volume ratio of the subgrids based on the number
c       of subgrids chosen by the user..
c    6. The number of subgrids for the solution space is defined by the
c       number of MPI ranks assigned to the run. For example, if as shown
c       above, salloc allocates 4 nodes, and there are 8 cores per node
c       as indicated in the mpirun command, then the original 1-block grid
c       will be automatically partitioned into 32 subgrids.
